> A generative Windows build studio - growing tailored OS environments from prompts

## 🌱 What is PLANT-MS?

PLANT-MS is a framework for spinning up tailored Windows environments as if they were living organisms grown to fit a specific role or persona. It treats the classic Windows desktop, its UI layers, and its installer logic as raw material that 80s/90s kids intuitively understand, then wraps that knowledge into a modern, prompt-driven experience.

The logo—a plant emerging from an MSI package inside a metallic emblem—captures the idea that every build is both engineered and organic, starting from a familiar "box" and unfolding into something uniquely adapted to the user's workflow.

## 🎯 Core Concept

PLANT-MS operationalises the metaphor through scripted provisioning pipelines:
- **Prompts and personas** are translated into repeatable build recipes
- **Documented behaviours** and transparent layers make complexity inspectable
- **Automated provisioning** shows how operating systems, interfaces, and automations grow over time

## 🚀 Use Cases

Create tailored Windows environments for:
- 📊 Bookkeepers
- 🏫 School administrators
- 🎮 Gamers
- 🎨 Content creators
- 💼 MSPs and IT professionals
- 🏠 Home labbers
- And many more...

## 📦 How It Works

1. **Prompt**: Describe your desired environment (e.g., "for a bookkeeper")
2. **Generation**: Watch as the system auto-builds a tailored OS profile
3. **Deployment**: Receive scripts, configurations, and automation recipes
4. **Customization**: Extend and modify builds to suit your exact needs
