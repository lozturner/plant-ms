# PLANT-MS Business Plan

## 1. Vision & Mission

**Vision:** Make Windows builds feel like living, growable systems that anyone can design through prompts and personas.

**Mission:** Provide a generative build studio that turns roles ("bookkeeper", "school admin", "creator") into reproducible, scriptable Windows environments, surfaced through engaging visual content and transparent automation.

## 2. Product Overview

PLANT-MS is a productised "build studio" for persona-based Windows environments:

- Users describe their role or use case.
- The system generates:
  - A deterministic provisioning script set.
  - A visual narrative (short video) of the build coming to life.
- Output is distributed as scripts, configuration packs, and optionally full images/VM templates.

Key differentiators:
- Strong nostalgic Windows aesthetic and narrative.
- Transparent, modular automation (no black-box magic).
- Content-first funnel via shorts and long-form breakdowns.

## 3. Target Customers

Primary segments:
- Technical creators and streamers who want bespoke Windows setups.
- Indie professionals (bookkeepers, writers, editors) who want a curated environment.
- MSPs and IT consultants who want reusable blueprints for client machines.
- Home labbers and tinkerers who enjoy watching and tweaking builds.

Secondary segments:
- Educators teaching OS concepts and automation.
- Tool builders and automation enthusiasts.

## 4. Value Proposition

For each persona, PLANT-MS offers:
- **Time savings**: pre-baked stacks with opinionated defaults.
- **Clarity**: everything is scripted and versioned, so builds are repeatable.
- **Education**: videos + docs show *why* each choice is made.
- **Aesthetic coherence**: branding, theming, and visual language aligned with the persona.

Tagline: **"Tell it your role. Watch your Windows build itself."**

## 5. Revenue Streams

1. **Membership (Patreon or equivalent)**
   - Tier 1: Access to standard build scripts and documentation.
   - Tier 2: Script packs + VM templates/images + priority support.
   - Tier 3: Custom build requests, voting rights for new personas, behind-the-scenes breakdowns.

2. **One-off Packs**
   - Persona-specific packs (e.g., "Creator Studio", "Bookkeeper Essentials") sold as downloads.

3. **Consulting & Custom Builds**
   - Bespoke environments for small teams, schools, or creators.

4. **Affiliate / Partner Integrations**
   - Curated software bundles via affiliate links where appropriate.

## 6. Go-To-Market Strategy

- **YouTube / Shorts / Reels**
  - Each build is a mini story: clean install → CLI automation → finished persona desktop.
  - CTA to GitHub and membership page for scripts.

- **GitHub Presence**
  - Public repo for open-source modules, docs, and examples.
  - Issues and Discussions used for persona ideas and feedback.

- **Telegram Community**
  - Channel for announcements and new drops.
  - Group for discussion, troubleshooting, and persona brainstorming.

- **Landing Page & Dashboard**
  - Simple prompt-based UI to define a persona, preview stack, and download scripts.

## 7. Product Roadmap (High Level)

**Phase 0 – Prototype (Weeks 1–4)**
- Define 5–10 initial personas.
- Build base automation pipeline for one Windows version.
- Ship initial GitHub repo with scripts and documentation.
- Release 1–2 "build story" videos.

**Phase 1 – Studio Launch (Months 2–3)**
- Expand library to 10–20 personas.
- Launch membership tiers and early supporter programme.
- Open Telegram community.
- Add simple web dashboard for persona selection and script download.

**Phase 2 – Automation & Scaling (Months 4–6)**
- Add template generation tooling for new personas.
- Introduce telemetry (opt-in) to understand which stacks are used most.
- Explore integrations with cloud VM providers.

**Phase 3 – Ecosystem (6+ Months)**
- Enable community-contributed personas and scripts.
- Curate "official" blessed templates.
- Partner with tool vendors relevant to specific personas.

## 8. Operations & Roles

- **Laurence & Oliver** as builders, narrators, and maintainers of the core stack.
- **Automation & DevOps**: maintain provisioning pipelines, CI for scripts, and test images.
- **Content**: script, film, and edit build stories.
- **Community**: moderate Telegram, triage GitHub issues, and coordinate persona roadmap.

Initially, all roles are shared; specialised roles can be added as the project grows.

## 9. Metrics & Success Criteria

- Number of active members/subscribers.
- Number of successful builds per persona.
- Engagement on videos (views, watch time, click-through to GitHub/membership).
- Community contributions (issues, PRs, persona suggestions).

## 10. Risks & Mitigations

- **Complexity creep**: Keep personas modular and well-documented; avoid one-off hacks.
- **Windows platform changes**: Version scripts carefully and pin supported versions.
- **Support overhead**: Use docs, FAQs, and community support before 1:1 help.
- **Licensing / OEM rules**: Respect Microsoft licensing; focus on automation, not distributing Windows itself.
